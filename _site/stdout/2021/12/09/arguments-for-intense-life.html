In that conversation, he mentioned this:</p><blockquote><p>[6:53 PM, 8/20/2021] But i think beneath that hasnt changed much<br /> [6:53 PM, 8/20/2021] Ok you werent as obsessed w speedrunning your life<br /> [6:53 PM, 8/20/2021] But there were defo signs of that<br /> [6:53 PM, 8/20/2021] Even in s4 lmao</p></blockquote><p>As compared to five years back, my life now is definitely more intense. I was a high school student back then and my world around me was the school. But now, as a college student, I feel the rest of the world approaching. The problems I can solve are no longer limited to just questions on an exam paper — I feel ready to take on challenges for the world-at-large. This sense of empowerment is somewhat intoxicating, and it is what makes me live my life rather intensely.</p><p>So, here are three arguments for the intense life.</p><h3 id="optimizing-for-least-regret">Optimizing for least regret</h3><p>We make plans that span over multiple time periods. What am I going to do today? What’s my schedule for the week? What’s my plan for the year? Where do I hope to end up in ten years?</p><p>In making these plans, we have to optimise for some sort of metric. What informs my decisions? What do I value? In this, my decisions ask the fundamental question: Which decision am I least likely to regret in the future?</p><p>We all know too well the feeling of the wasted year. Even at the age of 22 — just over a quarter of the average life expectancy in my country — I’ve had wasted years that sting a bit when I think about them. So I optimise for least regret, which more often than not results in a pretty intense life.</p><h3 id="now-is-almost-always-the-best-time">Now is almost always the best time</h3><p>Or alternatively — later is almost always a worse time.</p><p>Later is insidious, and it often turns out to be never. Often I make plans for the future and they rot away in the backlog. Next month may be a better time, but it only is better <em>ceteris paribus</em>. So I’ve come to think that the best way of doing the things I want to do is to do them <strong>now</strong>.</p><p>This way of thinking also helps me to overcome static friction. When trying to push a block on a level surface, it actually takes <em>more</em> force to start moving the block than to continue moving the block in motion. The activation energy needed to start on something is a lot bigger of a roadblock than it seems on the surface.</p><p>So how I do things is similar to implementing my to-do’s in a stack rather than a queue. Instead of procrastinating because the next item in the queue is a turn-off, I blaze through the things I want to do because there are tasks with actual deadlines further down the stack.</p><p>So this makes for a pretty intense life.</p><h3 id="mastery-takes-time">Mastery takes time</h3><p><a href="https://nabeelqu.co/understanding">Understanding is hard</a>. Our understanding of the world and the systems we have created are becoming increasingly complex over time.</p><p>This means that within a lifetime, the proportion of the world’s knowledge that we can obtain is getting smaller and smaller. To learn a field to a meaningful degree, it would take a considerable amount of time to dive deep into the vast pool of knowledge.</p><p>There’s only so much of life to know about so little of the world we live in. And even with our best efforts, <a href="https://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/">one person can only do so much</a> to expand the world’s knowledge. So we have to work on understanding the world everyday, bit by bit, and trying to make everyday meaningful like that makes for a pretty intense life.<br /> <br /></p><p>As medical technology improves, our lifespans are increasing, but the world around us is expanding at a much, much faster rate. So in light of our finite lifes, the best we can do is to live as much of it as possible.</p><h4 id="bonus-maxing-out-at-25-bookshelves">Bonus: Maxing out at 25 bookshelves</h4><p>I started reading when I was 20 and the average life expectancy in my country is 83.5 years. If I read an average of a book a week for the rest of my life, that works out to <strong>about 3,300 books</strong> that I can read in my lifetime. In the following bookshelf, you can see about 130 books. <img src="/assets/bookshelf.jpg" alt="A normal bookshelf with 130 books" /> This means that in my lifetime, I will only be able to read about 25 of these bookshelves. that doesn’t seem like a lot. Better start now.</p><span class="meta"><time datetime="2021-12-09T00:00:00+08:00">December 9, 2021</time> <!--<span class="meta"><time datetime="2021-12-09T00:00:00+08:00">December 9, 2021</time> &middot; </span> --></section></main></body></html>
